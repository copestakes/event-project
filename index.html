<p>The Planets: Concert Experience is a special event being hosted at The Mann Center in Fairmount Pakr, Philadephia, PA. From Friday October 22nd, to Sunday October 24th, John Smith and the Philadelphia orchestra with play The Planets, orginally composed in 1914-17 by English composer Gustav Holst. There are 7 main components, each representing a particular planet (Pluto had not yet been discovered). The inital reaction to the suite was negative, but quickly critics caught on to its quality. 

  Here at The Mann, conductor John Smith and the Philadelphia Orchestra will perform The Planets, with a small twist. Smith will introduce each planet and give background on how the section was originally composed. All the guests will have access to The Manns ammendities, as well as have free access to various food options in the form of food trucks. Hope to see you all there in late October!
